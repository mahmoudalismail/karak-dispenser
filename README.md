IoT Karak - [CarnegieApps 2017](http://www.carnegieapps.com) Mentors Hack

## Preamble

Fahim Dalvi and I were invited to mentor
[CarnegieApps 2017](http://www.carnegieapps.com) at
[Carnegie Mellon University Qatar](http://qatar.cmu.edu) (CMUQ) in January, 2017.

We were given the opportunity to present a hack. We presented this hack as a
token of appreciation for this hackathon and their organizers.   

This repository contains our hack. I hope you like the idea! Let us know what
you think!

## Glossary

- **IoT**   - Internet of Things
- **Karak** - A hot drink composed of tea and sweetened-milk; extremely popular
in the gulf region

## Motivation

The student body at CMUQ organizes a social every Thursday. An integral part
of this meetup is the offering of free Karak. We have noticed that people
love drinking karak to the point where they walk up to a pot and serve
selves. Therefore, given that we live in the world of IoT, we wanted to
automate this process and allow the pot to **automatically** serve
the people.

## Hack

We connected a pot of Karak to the internet and allowed people to ask the pot
for Karak wirelessly!

## Design

We built an intricate "arm" to pump the Karak out of the pot. This arm was
controlled by Raspberry Pi connected to the internet. All the user had to do
is to go to the pot's webpage and request a karak.

Below is a video for illustration. This video was shot in the testing phase. The pot contained water.

*Notice: we would have come up with a simpler and elegant hack if we
could have had more time, resources, and sleep (don't forget that
we were mentoring people)*

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank everyone for making this project possible and the hackathon family.

I would like to thank Fahim for working with me on, it was definitely fun
to work on something just for the fun of it. Also I would like to
thank Daanish Khan for providing us with lego blocks and the Raspberry Pi.
